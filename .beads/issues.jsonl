{"id":"kura-training-hwo","title":"Derivative-Enriched Projections: Werte mit eingebauter Dynamik","description":"## Ursprung\n\nAus einem Vortrag über ein mathematisches Framework mit diesen Eigenschaften:\n- Basic type ist Winkel (periodisch), mit variabler Auflösung und Dimensionen\n- Winkel sind nicht statisch, sondern dynamisch (enthalten Info über ihre eigene Veränderung im nächsten Schritt, 1-3 Ableitungen)\n- Kurze, periodische Propagationen (wenige Schichten)\n- Niedrige Auflösung von Werten und Gradienten\n\n## Was das für Kura ausgelöst hat\n\n### Kernproblem heute\nProjections sind **Zustandsfotos**. Eine 1RM ist eine Zahl, ein Wochenvolumen ist eine Zahl. Der Agent muss Trends *selbst rekonstruieren*, indem er Zeitreihen vergleicht. Und ob ein Trend an Fahrt gewinnt oder verliert (Beschleunigung), muss er aus Trends ableiten. Das ist viel kognitive Arbeit für den Agenten — und fehleranfällig.\n\n### Idee: Werte tragen ihre eigenen Ableitungen\nStatt:\n```json\n{\"bench_press_1rm\": 100.0}\n```\nKönnte ein Wert seine Dynamik mitbringen:\n```json\n{\n  \"bench_press_1rm\": {\n    \"value\": 100.0,\n    \"velocity\": 2.5,\n    \"acceleration\": -0.5\n  }\n}\n```\nEin einziger Lesevorgang sagt dem Agenten: \"Du bist bei 100kg, wirst stärker (+2.5kg/Woche), aber die Zuwächse flachen ab (-0.5kg/Woche²).\"\n\n### Drei konkrete Designprinzipien\n\n**1. Derivative-enriched projections**\nJeder quantitative Wert in einer Projection trägt Richtung und Momentum. Der Agent liest nicht \"Zahl + Zeitreihe\", sondern \"Zustand + Dynamik\". Erweiterung des Projection-Formats, kein neues System.\n\n**2. Phase statt Trend**\nStatt \"1RM steigt\" modellieren wir \"User ist in Phase X eines Zyklus\". Training ist fundamental zyklisch:\n- Wochenrhythmus (welche Tage, Lastverteilung)\n- Mesozyklus (Akkumulation → Intensivierung → Deload → Peak)\n- Supercompensation (Belastung → Ermüdung → Erholung → Überkompensation)\n- Schlaf, Ernährung haben Wochenmuster\n\nWinkel/periodische Werte sind die natürliche Darstellung für zyklische Phänomene. Jemand in der Deload-Woche sieht nach \"Regression\" aus wenn man nur linear schaut — Phase-Modellierung erkennt das als normal.\n\n**3. Low resolution, high meaning**\nDer Agent braucht keine Präzision. Er braucht:\n- ↑↑ (steigt beschleunigt)\n- ↑→ (steigt, flacht ab)\n- →↓ (stagniert, kippt)\nDas ist fast die \"angle with low resolution\"-Idee: wenige diskrete Zustände, aber dynamisch.\n\n## Wo das hingehört\n\nNatürlicher Ort ist die **Bayesian-Schicht (kqf)**. Die Bayesian Engine berechnet nicht nur Schätzwerte, sondern Schätzwerte *mit ihren Ableitungen*. Die Projections werden dadurch von \"Fakten, aus denen der Agent Dynamik ableiten muss\" zu \"Fakten MIT Dynamik\".\n\nAuch ohne Bayesian könnte man einfache Derivative-Enrichment auf bestehende Projections anwenden (lineare Regression über letzte N Wochen → velocity, Änderung der velocity → acceleration). Aber die Bayesian-Schicht macht es richtig (Unsicherheitsquantifizierung, nicht-lineare Trends, zyklische Modelle).\n\n## Was wir bewusst NICHT übernehmen\n\n\"Short periodic propagations (few layers at a time)\" auf die Worker-Pipeline zu mappen wäre erzwungen. Projections recomputen vollständig, nicht inkrementell. Vielleicht relevant bei massiver Skalierung, aber nicht jetzt.\n\n## Bezug zu bestehender Architektur\n\n- Passt zu agent_behavior: Agent bekommt reichere Daten → kann autonomere Entscheidungen treffen\n- Passt zu projection_schemas: output_schema erweitern um derivative-enriched Typen\n- Passt zu data_quality: velocity/acceleration mit Konfidenz → Agent weiß, wie verlässlich die Dynamik-Info ist\n- Decision 10 Phase 4 (Cross-Pollination): Derivative-Enrichment könnte ein Cross-Dimension Pattern sein (gleiche Logik für 1RM, Gewicht, Schlafqualität)","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"jonzim@posteo.de","created_at":"2026-02-10T20:27:08.940161+01:00","created_by":"jonzim-cmd","updated_at":"2026-02-11T13:07:14.99276+01:00","closed_at":"2026-02-11T13:07:14.99276+01:00","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"kura-training-hwo","depends_on_id":"kura-training-kqf","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-10T20:27:12.598247+01:00","created_by":"jonzim-cmd"}]}
